  <h2> Affiliations </h2>
  <hr/>
  <p> My name is Alexandra Ahlschlager and over summer, I've been attending Girls Who Code where I learn how to program along with other young women. I attend Presentation High School and am involved in some clubs like Panthers Exploring Medicine and the Badminton club. I also attend Lord of the Light, an art class that I’ve been going to since Kindergarten.  </p>

  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>I’m really into different types of art. I currently attend an art class, Lord of the Light, but I also love doodling on the corners of papers and making things outside of class, like sewing pencil cases or pouches. I also go to an organization, Awana, where I get to help out with kids which is super fun.</p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p> I think some of my skills include being really focused and dedicated to everything I do. I try to make everything I do the very best it can be, from being functional to being just aesthetically pleasing. I’m also a pretty good listener and always try to understand a person first before making judgments. I’m also pretty good at math, if that can be considered a skill. </p>

  <h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p> I love dumplings and am obsessed with ice cream. My favorite restaurant is Tofu House, a Korean restaurant, and I love Japanese food, especially sushi. </p>

  <h2>Places I Want to Travel</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p> I’ve always wanted to visit Iceland because the landscape just seems beautiful in every picture I’ve seen and I would love to see the Northern Lights. I also feel like going to Bora Bora would be amazing (if I had the money) because I love tropical places and the water looks super clear and gorgeous. </p>
